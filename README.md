# VoxEngine
This is my attempt creating my own Voxel Renderer in C++ using Vulkan.

## Compiling & Running
1. Install [xmake](https://xmake.io/)
2. Run `xmake` to build the project
3. The binary is in `build/{mode}-{os}-{architecture}/VoxApp/bin`
4. To run it, you can either click it or run it by typing `xmake run` in the console.
